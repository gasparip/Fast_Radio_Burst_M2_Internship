Project Internship README

Overview:

The Project_internship directory encompasses various sub-projects, each serving a specific purpose related to radio astronomy observations and signal processing. Below are details about each sub-project.

1. Project_Data_Base_Project:

   Purpose:
   - Sorting observations made by NenuFAR.
   - Creating correlation plots between different Radiotelescope observations.

2. Project_FRB_Observation:

   Purpose:
   - Signal processing for each observation made by NenuFAR.
   - Saving and sorting processed data into different directories.

3. Project_Parametre_Optimisation:

   Purpose:
   - Containing scripts for optimizing signal processing parameters.

4. Project_RFI_Treatment:

   Purpose:
   - Handling Radio Frequency Interference (RFI).
   - Tasks include plotting, filtering, destruction, or classification of RFI.

5. Project_Simulation:

   Purpose:
   - Creating Fast Radio Burst (FRB) simulations.
   - Scripts for incorporating simulations into observations and processing the new data.

6. Project_WeeklyReport:

   Purpose:
   - Automating processing for each observation made during the week.
   - Generating reports and sending them via email.

7. Script:
  - Contains useful scripts for various purposes.
